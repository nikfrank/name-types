# name types

the idea is to generate JSON ish type definitions based on all the usage of variable names in your codebase.

creates docs for all assignments, parameter instantiation, react-prop assignment, evaluations, subsequent assignment (into named variable / param / react-prop)

perhaps could be used to generate efficient database structures by just reading your js, and bind state updates thereto (creating a per-user-context copy of whatever state you make.

so prototyping a RESTful db would be eliminated from mvp, speeding delivery.
